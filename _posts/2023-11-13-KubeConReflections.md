# My random notes pre-writing
We cannot do anything the way we have it now

We must prepare for the ai future, so that we accelerate with it. Not lagging behind. 

frustration with technology limitations. 

How do I lead us forward???

Focus. what were the takeaways from today: 
Complexity is a tax. We cannot add complexity, but we need to make some complexity trades. 
Incremental changes vs incremental improvements

# The actual "blog" 
My writing needs work. It has taken me 3 days and as many tries to get my thoughts togeter enough to write anything. And I struggle to stay convicted to my own thoughts. I find that I doubt myself, despite all the events and beliefs that I claim to believe. I don't want to be controversial. I don't want to fail. But these are my thoughts as I see them now. 

10X People has lots of room for improvement. We are locked in to our current tech stack because out tech stack is a hodgepodge of things done over time to simply "make it work". Making it just work makes it scattered and the knowledge is tribal, rather than actually documented. This makes containerization extremely hard. 

Containerization is the way we need to be going. It is the way out of our vendor lock-in. It is the way out of our limited ability to adapt and handle change. Yet, at the same time, containerization is not the issue at all. It is a lack of technical leadership and knowledge. We cannot learn about what we don't know about. We cannot implement what we cannot understand. 

This is dangerous, because at the moment, we are still able to get the job done. Will that end if things get shaken up into this new world order of containerization and gitOps? Will we truly be able to slow down now, and make up that time with the resulting acceleration? I suppose for me, it doesn't matter either way. I have no choice. I cannot sit aside and do nothing. It is either try, or go for me. My brain won't allow any further stagnation. 

Complexity is another thing that needs thought about complexity will increase through the adoption of new things, but it too must come down to levels lower than prior. Simplicity is the end goal.

This has all been rather rambly and abstract. I shall try again, with some hard details.
