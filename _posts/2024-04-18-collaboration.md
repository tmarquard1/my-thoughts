# Seniority
I wonder what it looks like at "real" tech companies to have senior developers. Personally, I don't want to be the best at something. I want to be good and always improving. That seems hard when you know the most, but maybe not. Maybe it is a matter of people who know less still being vocal about their own solutions. Maybe it means that seniority needs to let go of what they know and try something new. Or let go of ego, and admit that their idea could be better. I desire a place where I can be good at something, but with the unity of an awesome team, be collectively great at something. And have fun along the way. Problem solving together is always a great time. Throwing out ideas and trying new things. Iterating on problems. Coming back to the basics to try something fundamentally different. 

I crave the place where ideas have the space and opportunity to bloom. The devops at work don't empower people to try things. It limits them. I'd like to find more and better ways to empower people to make things their own. To take on challenges and find ways to solve their problems, and share their solutions with the team. Not always be working in solos but break down those barriers for a common ease of work life. 

In summation. Seniority should be the ability to give others tools so that they can build the things you never could have dreamed of.
