### Debrief - August 21, 2024

It is the beginning. Day three of graduate school (well.. and online MSCE program and only taking 1 class). It feel already challenging to balance it all, but partially because I don't think I have fully comprehended the fact I am in school again. No more procrastinating random side projects anymore. Time is feeling limited. Run, work, school, sleep, repeat. With some food thrown in of course... and maybe a little Youtube. 

Listing to the BEMA podcast and thinking about what God tells us, I want to prioritize rest. My work comes from my rest. My rest is not earned by my work. My value is in who I am, and not what I can do. Rest, Run, Work, School. 

Note, that I know I should do a proper citation, but instead here are the titles to some papers and then some misc thoughts about them:
The unreasonable effectiveness of deep learning in artificial intelligence, Neuroscience 2020
IoT technologies for embedded computing: A survey, CODES+ISSS 2016

Between the two I have had some thoughts. I really think I should learn K8s. In the first, thinking of distributing the load of day to day processing to highty specialized ML models is going to need that "neural cortex" to handle all the "traffic". This is assuming a goal of AGI, FYI. Good out of order thoughts. But K8s control node seems like the right kind of architecture for this kind of distributed and coordinated data processing. I know that it is already making inroads in ML training. I'll be curious to see how that progresses. Or day I even say contribute?!?! ü§Ø. Nah. I'd have to get over the hump of being a learner to being an inovator. Ha.

With my array of random devices and things I have bought over the last few weeks, I think I could put together something pretty cool. Coordinating the camera to observe something and funnel the results to a set of lights seems cool. Kinda silly. Maybe too simple? We'll see what kind of layers I can add to it. I am imagining pointing the camera at myself and basically making an OP mood ring. 

Question, how do I get data from my Garmin watch to somewhere I can play with it? 

Goal. Write up a more thoughtful post and .. yeah know.. post it.
