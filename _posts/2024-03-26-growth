I am excited to have 4 quality candidates for the 10X summer internship. Meeting and talking to students always seems to energize me. All the potential and excitement is contagious. I look to hire energy and desire to learn. Those that are excited to learn and to challenge themselves are great to work with. I also find myself drawn to those that I feel may be a bit timid, or afraid. I remember myself in those shoes. Scared. Choking on easy questions. Sometimes someone just needs a little grace, support, and an opportunity to show what they are capable of. 

Growth does not happen in a vaccuum. I know I can learn skills alone. I can figure things out and try to apply them. But that always means that I am learning solutions that have already been solved. It does help in the re-inforcement of the lessons. But without any true feedback cycle, only I can say what I learned and how things have improved. It is a hollow cycle without the outside perspective. 

I want to improve my writing skills. So even if it is just a little bit a day, I hope to put something in this. We'll see.
